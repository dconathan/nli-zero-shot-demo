# NLI for Zero Shot Classification Demo

This is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how NLI models can be used for zero shot classification.  It is similar in implementation to the built-in Huggingface [ZeroShotClassificationPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.1/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.ZeroShotClassificationPipeline).

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```
